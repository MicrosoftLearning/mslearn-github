# Overview

The following exercises are designed to provide you with a hands-on learning experience where you'll explore common tasks GitHub users perform when collaborating on projects.

> **Note**: To complete the exercises, you'll need an Azure subscription in which you have sufficient permissions and quota to provision the necessary Azure resources. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

Some exercises may have additional, or different, requirements. Those will contain a **Before you start** section specific to that exercise.
